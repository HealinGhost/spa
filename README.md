This is a frontend application containing my attempt on creating a desktop on a website format.
The following desktop currently provides 3 functional applications
1. A chat application connected using a websocket to a broadcast server
2. A memory game
3. A magic 8-ball application, that will try to answer any of your questions.

To run this application simply download the project from the branch and run the following commands
* <b>"npm install"</b>
* <b>"npm run serve"</b>
